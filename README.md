ARUGUMENTATION REALITY

The hypothesis is to build an Augmented reality application having the capability of showing virtual images of the products in the real world while shopping online using Marker-less Tracking through Vuforia SDK which uses QCAR algorithm for object detection and feature extraction.

OBJECTIVE AND SCOPE

1. To provide virtual view of the products.
2. To provide rendering of the view in all directions.
3. Not causing any hindrances when user changes the camera view.
4. Provide the application for all types of devices.

CONCLUSION

The application working on Marker-based tracking uses QR code for tracking an object . The QR code is placed in the environment where the user wishes to view the model. The application recognizes the code and then place the object on the code only. Carrying the code every time is not possible for the user.
 Hence, this application uses Marker-less Tracking for tracking of virtual objects.As in Marker-based Tracking the system recognizes the code to track the module, in the Marker-less Tracking the objects are tracked using QCAR algorithm of Tracker module. In this case, no such QR ode is required.
